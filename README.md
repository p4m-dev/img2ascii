# img2ascii
Image to ascii converter created in learning purposes

CLI programm gets image, and convert it to ASCII format. 

Example:

Source image:
![Source image](static/mem.jpg)

P.S Result insertes as image because for better viewing of resilt image resolution need to be close to original. And it is really a lot of text!
